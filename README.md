# HTML5b

An HTML5 port of Cary Huang's flash game [BFDIA 5b](http://bfdi.tv/5b/) using only pureJS and HTML5. All gameplay, level creator, and explore features have been fully implemented.

A lot of the code in here I didn't write. Since actionscript is so similar to javascript; a lot of the code was just copy-pasted from the decompiled swf with some minor reformatting.
